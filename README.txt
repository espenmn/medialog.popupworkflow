What is this?
=============

- This Plone product gives you a new popup_workflow so you can publish an item for pop-up effect. 
- When clicking on it in the navigation menu or wherever the state class  is shown (like in folder_listing, tableview, )
- The popup effect is disabled when logged in (so its possible to *edit content the normal way*)

Warning: Version 4.1 is for Plone 4.1, 4.2 etc ONLY. Use version 0.7 for Plone 4.0


How-to
==================
- Install medialog.popupworkflow
- Change workflow of a folder or content type or *something* to *Popup workflow*
- *Change state* of some content to *Popup Publish*. For security reasons, the *change view* menu is now *disabled*. You will need to *Normal Publish* it to change view.
- Log out, or use another browser
- Click on that item in the navigation portlet

If you uninstall the product, you should uninstall or reinstall collective.prettyphoto
